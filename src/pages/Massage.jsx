            <p>Massage is the manipulation of soft tissues in the body. Massage techniques are commonly applied with
                hands, fingers, elbows, knees, forearm, feet, or a device. The purpose of massage is generally for the
                treatment of body stress or pain. A person who was professionally trained to give massages was
                traditionally known as a masseur (male) or a masseuse (female), but those titles are outmoded, and carry
                some negative connotations. In the United States, the title massage therapist has been recognized as a
                business norm for those who have been professionally trained to give massages.</p>
